# Inheritance

An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.

>Points to remember
- Interface gives full abstraction
- Multiple inheritance is possible in Interface
- Multiple implementaion is also possible
- can have default or static method
