# Package

Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces.

>Points
- Preventing naming conflicts. For example there can be two classes with name Employee in two packages, college.staff.cse.Employee and college.staff.ee.Employee
- Making searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier
- Packages can be considered as data encapsulation (or data-hiding).
